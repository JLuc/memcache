Possible alerts

- bins in a cluster are not matched in size
- clock deviation within servers (and with the client) outside some limit
- inconsistent builds between servers
- variation on connection and answer delay
- non-zero eviction rate 
- inconsistent slab factors between bins
- multiple uses of same bin in monitor config
- rusage_* increase on some servers outside normal variations
- inconsistent uptimes
- optimizations: different slabs factor simulation shows less memory use than current
